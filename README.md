# Subject-13

1. What does this project do? This project is called Subject 13. It is a choose-your-own-adventure game where you can play either as a scientist or as a subject. You must make decisions that will determine your fate as you navigate through a laboratory full of secrets.

2. Why did I make this project? I have always wanted to make a choose-your-own-adventure game but have never really gotten around to it. I figured I would make one as kind of a fun project (as a break) after finishing a harder project (MoodPet). I figured it would help keep my HTML and CSS skills polished for my upcoming project that I think will be using more HTML/CSS.

3. How did I make this project? I started by drafting the overall storylines and where each decision would take you. From there I started with the Subject POV and went scene by scene. I would finish the HTML and CSS for each scene and go down one story branch. Once I finished that story branch, I would move on to the next and so on.

4. What did I struggle with the most and what did I learn? I struggled the most with two things. The first was just keeping everything in order and organized. There were a lot of times where I got confused trying to juggle so many different storylines and scenes. However, I managed to get through it by working systematically in an organized manner. In this project, I was also able to learn a lot more about overlays, as I had never actually worked with them before. I got a much better understanding of HTML and CSS.
