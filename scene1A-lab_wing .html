                        You step into the Lab Wing, where shattered containment pods and overtruned chairs lie in the flickering light.
                        In front of you, a damanged terminal still flickers with fragments of data. To you right, the coridor is pitch black and blocked by debris.
                        It has a gap just wide enough for you to crawl through.

                        Despite subject 13 retaining clarity, serveral test subjects have begun exhibiting erratic behaviors. Reports cite sudden aggression and signs of cognitive overload.
