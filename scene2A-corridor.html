                        You crawl through the broken debris and hear… movement. You spot something: a shadowy figure
                        limping in the dark. You hide behind a large chunk of rubble and wait for it to pass.
                        It's wearing the same jumpsuit as you, and you think you saw the number “12” stitched
                        into its clothes. Up ahead, a maintenance tunnel offers a chance to flee.
